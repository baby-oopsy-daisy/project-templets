      Step 1:
        Clone or Download the repo to your local machine.

      Step 2:
        Make sure you have node and npm install
        { 
          { for node : type the following in terminal -> ("node --version") to check for the existance of node.
          for npm : type type the following in terminal -> ("npm --version") to check for the existance of npm.
        }

      Step 3:
        After cloning/downloading the repository go into "project-templets" folder.
        and Open terminal under administrative privilege.

      Step 4:
        type -> "npm i" (to install the ncessary modules)

      Step 5: 
        type -> "npm link"

      /* once the above steps are completed successfully go to  "templets" folder 

        There are two folders, you can delete them and create your own custom templets

        (I work with p5.js snd d3.js so my folders contain the html,css,js files I use in my prohects)
      */

      Step 6:
        After creating your custom templets, you need to link again.
        So open cmd and type-> "npm link' (this is to be done whenever you make changes to the current templets or add new ones)
}
  
  
USE:
  {
      After successfully going to the abobe steps, your life is going to be much easier now.
      No need to create folders or files or writing the initial same code over and over again.

      Just open the folder whete you want to create a new project.
      Open terminal and type "startproject"
      { You will see somthing like below:
            " ? What project template would you like to generate? (Use arrow keys)
            > html-offline
              html-online "

       Insted of " html-offline & html-online " you will see the folders you have created 
       (inside which you have already craeted your custom templets).

       Choose the folder whos templet you wish to use.
       Then you will be prompted to give your project a name, do so and hit Enter.
  }
  
   
AWESOME! you have created a new project in just two lines of code, with all the initial code already written in it.
No need to type the same old templet again and again.

-> NOTES:
    -> for your custom templets, you can also store your lib. lifes in them
    -> whatever is in your chosen folder i.e " project-templets/templets/(your custome templet folder)"
       will be copied as itis in your project folder.
    -> changes made in your project folder will not reflect in your templet folder. they are local to your project only.
    -> feel free to explore and use my templets to explore the tools, before setting up your own custom templet.
